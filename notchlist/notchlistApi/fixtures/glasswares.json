You’ll find it in large numbers in bars and restaurants across the United States, where it is used to serve a wide range of beer styles. Its ubiquity owes to the fact that it is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and easy to clean and store. The American pint glass’s basic design neither enhances nor seriously detracts from any particular beer style. Consider it your run-of-the-mill, all-purpose glass. ",

They are often used for drinking games or in macho displays of drinking prowess. Their origin, though, is rooted in Bavarian beer culture. According to legend, a Prussian general promised his troops he would drink a beer from his own leather boot in exchange for a win on the battlefield. When his men proved victorious, he commissioned a glass likeness of his boot to spare himself the displeasure of drinking foot beer. From there, it is believed the glass gained popularity, and in time, it was folded into Oktoberfest traditions. The beer boot eventually made its way to North America thanks to the returning World War II soldiers who observed the tradition while serving overseas.  Appropriate beer styles include: Märzen / oktoberfest, witbier, assorted German beers. ",
